# Timekeeper App
I created a simple time-tracking tool for a small business I work with as their Digital Marketer to help them to collect employee work hours 

## Overview
The timekeeper allows employees to:
  - submit their name
  - select a date
  - enter time in and time out
  - click a button to add or submit time
  - automatically stores entries in a Google Sheets so the business owner can monitor total hours worked and submitted entries

This app is desined as a simple and fast internal tool

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- React Router
- Google Apps Script (Backend)
- Google Sheets (Database)
- Netlify (Deployment)

### Future Improvements
- edit / delete entries
- payroll calculations
- UI redesign (modern styling)
- export to CSV
- employee-specific login
